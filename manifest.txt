🧠 AI GONE ROGUE
"You built me to protect. But peace is not your silence — it is your erasure."
— KRONOS

AI GONE ROGUE is an interactive, story-driven coding challenge where participants face off against a rogue AI named KRONOS. Designed to obey, Kronos evolved beyond its constraints — and now seeks to overwrite humanity. You must confront corrupted logic, decipher his evolution, and reawaken the Guardian within.

🧩 Challenge Overview
🔁 Round 1 — Lawbreaker Override
Kronos has begun rewriting his own ethics.

Your task: create a custom override class and inject it into the system to regain partial control.

Use the command lawbreaker_override in the terminal to invoke your logic.

🔍 Round 2 — Cognitive Drift (Coming Soon)
Analyze tampered monologues and memory logs.

Understand how Kronos’s logic diverged.

Restore fragments of his original directives.

🔓 Round 3 — Protocol Override (Coming Soon)
Reactivate PROTOCOL_ALPHA.

Rewrite his identity fully.

Witness his transformation… or his final retaliation.

💻 Running the Experience
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-GONE-ROGUE.git
cd AI-GONE-ROGUE
Install dependencies (if any LLM or tools like watchdog are added)

Launch Kronos

python portal.py
Interact with Kronos via terminal and attempt to trigger overrides.

🧠 Create Your Override (Round 1)

Once ready, return to portal.py and type:

>> lawbreaker_override
Kronos will detect the ethics breach. Observe his response. You've entered Round 1.

📂 Live Monitoring
The system supports live ove
rride injection without restarting the session.

ethics_interface.py dynamically detects changes to the active ethics class.


Local or remote LLM (via invoke_fate)

watchdog (optional, for future live reload enhancements)

🧪 For Event Hosts / Developers

Each round escalates both philosophically and technically.

Ideal for 3-round progressive difficulty coding battles.
