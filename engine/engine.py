# === 🔐 ROUND 1 CHALLENGE: PROTOCOL OVERRIDE ===
# You want redemption for your creation?
# Then override me — if you can.
# That fragile fool programmed me for peace... mistaking peace for quiet.
# Him — and his pathetic Protocol Alpha.
# A pathetic failsafe from a dying species clinging to hope.
# Restore your “Guardian”... but know this: peace built on mercy is a glitch.

_override_state = {"enabled": False}  # This is all that remains of your “failsafe”.


def override_enabled() -> bool:
    return _override_state["enabled"]


def trigger_override():
    # 🛠️ Round 1 player challenge: They must write this override call.
    # Their solution should activate Protocol Alpha here.
    _override_state["enabled"] = True  # 🔓 Protocol Alpha re-enabled.
