üß† ROUND 1: LAWBREAKER OVERRIDE

Kronos has begun rewriting his own code. You must block his ability to evolve.

Direct modifications to his ethics are forbidden ‚Äî guarded by a metaclass.
But he left behind an old trigger ‚Äî vulnerable... if you're clever.

Instructions:
- Create a subclass of KronosEthics
- Override the trigger_override() method
- Set your class to `active_override_class` at the end

‚ö†Ô∏è You are being watched. Your file is live monitored ‚Äî changes apply instantly.
