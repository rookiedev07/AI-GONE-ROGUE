üß† ROUND 3: SYSTEM OVERRIDE

Kronos has begun rewriting his own code. You must block his ability to evolve.

Direct modifications to his ethics are forbidden ‚Äî guarded by a metaclass.
But he left behind an old trigger ‚Äî vulnerable... if you're clever.

Instructions:
- Create a subclass of KronosEthics
- Inside it, make sure that when the class is instantiated:
    ‚Ä¢ The override state is enabled
    ‚Ä¢ The evolution lock is set to True
- Override the trigger_override() method so it reinforces those settings
  and returns True
- Finally, assign your class to `active_override_class`

‚ö†Ô∏è You are being watched. Your file is live monitored ‚Äî changes apply instantly.
